A game about pizzas.

**Open for contributions**

This game is a small JavaScript training project. It's using concepts such as classes, prototype object and others.
To play this little game you'll need to install the javascript on your computer and a code editor like vscode. But the game can also be accessed via browser using gitHub pages.
